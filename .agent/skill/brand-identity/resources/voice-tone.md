# Copywriting: Voice & Tone Guidelines

## Voice & Tone
*   **Do:** Be direct, practical, confident, and calm. Emphasize progress and habits.
*   **Avoid:** Slang, guilt-based messaging, overpromising, dense paragraphs, aggressive urgency.

## Vocabulary
*   **Preferred:** "Earned," "track," "prove," "progress," "weekly."
*   **Forbidden:** "Act now or else", kid-slang.

## Writing Rules
*   **Headings:** Short (under 8 words). Title Case.
*   **Body:** Scannable. No all-caps.
*   **Tone:** Respectful, parent-focused.
