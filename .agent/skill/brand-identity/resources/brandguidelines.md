HomeWork: Brand Identity & Interface Guidelines
Version 1.0 | The "Cupertino" Aesthetic

01. The Core Philosophy
The Manifesto of Essentialism

HomeWork is not a utility for chore management. It is a friction-free operating system for the family economy. It exists to distill complex concepts—effort, value, delayed gratification—into a singular, intuitive interface that requires zero cognitive load to understand.

Our design ethos is "Subtractive." We do not add features; we remove barriers to understanding. If an element does not directly contribute to the "aha moment" of realizing the connection between work and reward, it must be eliminated. The resulting experience should feel inevitable, as if it were the only natural way to solve this problem.

The Emotional Promise

We are selling clarity and optimism. For the parent, HomeWork is the relief of an automated, fair system. For the child, it is the dignity of agency and visible progress. The visual language must reflect this dual promise: authoritative enough to be trusted, yet warm enough to be embraced in the intimate setting of a home.

12. Voice and Tone
The HomeWork voice is that of a quiet, competent partner. It never nags, cajoles, or celebrates excessively. It presents reality with beautiful precision.

Confident, Not Arrogant: We state facts. "Balance: $12.50." We do not need exclamation points to make financial progress exciting; the data is exciting on its own.

Restrained & Clairvoyant: We anticipate the user's next move. The interface offers the right action at the right time (e.g., the "Claim Bounty" button appearing only when relevant). The copy is minimal. If a visual element can communicate the message, do not use text.

Optimistic: The vocabulary should lean toward growth. Use words like "Build," "Earn," "Progress," and "Claim," rather than "Debt," "Owe," or "Chore."

13. Visual Identity System
The Logomark: "The Domestic Ascendant"

The HomeWork icon is a unified glyph representing the fusion of domestic life and economic upward mobility. It is constructed with strict geometric precision.

Construction: The mark is composed of a stylized domicile outline integrated with a rising bar graph that culminates in an arrow. The stroke width is uniform. The corners are rounded using a continuous curvature (squircle geometry) to appear friendly and approachable, avoiding sharp, aggressive angles.

The Container: The glyph always resides within an Apple-standard superellipse container. It is never allowed to float freely without its bounding box in app contexts.

Clear Space: The minimum clear space around the logo is equal to 25% of the container's height on all sides. No other graphic elements may intrude into this zone.

The Color System: "Luminescent Energy"

Our color palette is not flat; it is made of light. The primary identity is defined by a specific, vibrant gradient that suggests the transition from clarity to energy.

Primary Gradient: The "Momentum" Blend
This gradient is the soul of the brand. It is used for the app icon, the primary action buttons, and the progress indicators. It should always be rendered with a subtle inner glow, making it appear to emit light.

Start (Top Left/Blue): "Catalyst Blue"

Hex: #3B82F6 (Approximate based on visual)

Represents: Trust, clarity, structure, the "Home."

End (Bottom Right/Orange): "Kinetic Orange"

Hex: #F97316 (Approximate based on visual)

Represents: Action, warmth, reward, the "Work."

Secondary Palette: The Canvas
The environment in which the gradient lives must be obsessively clean to allow the primary colors to "pop."

Photon White: #FFFFFF - The absolute background.

Vapor Grey: #F3F4F6 - Used for subtle layering, secondary cards, and unselected states.

Obsidian text: #111827 - For primary data and headlines. Never pure black; a deep, rich charcoal.

Neutral Text: #6B7280 - For secondary labels and timestamps.

Typography: "Invisible Precision"

Typography must be functional above all else. It should be so clean that the user doesn't notice the font, only the information it conveys.

Primary Typeface: SF Pro (San Francisco). If SF Pro is unavailable (e.g., non-Apple web environments), Helvetica Neue is the mandated fallback.

Hierarchy & Weight:

Data is Hero: Financial figures (e.g., "$12.50") are the most important visual element on any screen. They should be rendered in a heavy weight (Bold or Heavy) and large scale.

Labels act as scaffolding: Labels like "Balance" or "New Bounty!" should be significantly smaller, using Medium or Regular weights in the Neutral Text color.

Kerning: Tracking should be slightly tightened on large headlines for a dense, impactful feel, and slightly loosened on small caps labels for readability.

14. Interface Guidelines (The Tactile UX)
The HomeWork interface is not a flat picture; it is a layered, tactile environment composed of light and premium materials.

The "Luminary" Progress Ring

As seen in the child dashboard, progress is not shown as a static bar. It is a glowing, cyclical ring using the "Momentum" gradient.

Behavior: The ring must feel alive. The colored portion should have a soft, radiated glow, appearing to cast colored light onto the white background beneath it.

Cap & Track: The ends of the progress arc are rounded. The "empty" track behind it is a subtle, translucent Vapor Grey.

Materiality & Layering

Glassmorphism: The interface uses subtle translucency and background blurring (glassmorphism) to establish hierarchy. Primary cards or modals should feel like panes of frosted glass sliding over the background, giving a sense of depth.

Soft Shadows: We do not use harsh drop shadows. Depth is created using large, highly diffused, soft ambient shadows that make elements feel like they are floating millimeters above the surface.

The Button as Object: The primary action button (e.g., "Claim Bounty") is not a flat rectangle. It is a pill-shaped object with the "Momentum" gradient. It must have a subtle specular highlight on the top edge, making it look like a physical, pressable lozenge.

Ecosystem Continuity

The experience must be seamless across devices.

Phone (Child Focus): Immediate, singular focus. Large data, single primary action.

Tablet (Parent Focus): Dashboard architecture. Clean grids, scannable lists, data density balanced by white space.

Watch (Notification Focus): Glanceable. High-contrast text against deep black. The icon and the core message only.

15. Imagery and Context
How HomeWork is presented in the world is as important as the app itself. The context must reinforce the premium, aspirational nature of the product.

Environment: The app is always shown in idealized, sunlit domestic spaces. Think architectural digest modernism—light oak wood surfaces, minimalist furniture, abundant natural light. No clutter.

Hardware: The app is only ever presented on the latest generation Apple hardware (iPhone Pro models, iPad Pro, Apple Watch Ultra). The hardware colors should be neutral (Silver, Titanium) so as not to compete with the app's gradient.

Photography Style: High-key lighting, shallow depth of field (focus sharp on the screen, background beautifully blurred), obsessive attention to reflections on the device screen. The product is the hero; the environment is the supporting cast.
